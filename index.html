<p class="vision"><strong>VISION/INTENT</strong></p>

<p class="vision">In the summer of 2012, Danny and Alex were both interested in attending one of the programming schools known as a boot camp. They realized there was barely any information available on this new and innovative industry. Most <q>guides</q> were simply rehashed information and a list of links. 
</p>

<p class="vision">The cost of a bootcamp is very high. Tuition alone can run into the tens of thousands.  Many students are also quitting their jobs and moving across the country to attend one. This is a major life decision and there is barely any research to look at.
</p>

<p class="vision">
Until now. 
</p>

<p class="vision">
PushBC will be the authoritative source on bootcamps. We will launch with interviews with all the major bootcamp founders. There will also be student reviews of the programs. We want to avoid the casual feel of sites like yelp, so these reviews will be paid for. This is to make them as professional and helpful as possible. Articles will be longform rather than short and chatty.
